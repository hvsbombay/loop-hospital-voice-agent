**Intern** **Assignment:** **AI** **Voice** **Agent** **for**
**Hospital** **Network**

**Assignment** **Overview:**

The task is to create a conversational AI voice agent that can answer
user queries about a large network of hospitals. The agent will be
accessed through a simple web interface. The core challenge involves
enabling the agent to accurately retrieve information from a dataset
that is assumed to be too large to fit into a standard AI model's
context window.

This project is designed to evaluate your skills in integrating
third-party APIs, overcoming data retrieval challenges, and developing a
functional, end-to-end application.

**Data** **Source:** A large CSV file containing a list of several
thousand network hospitals and their addresses is <u>[attached with this
assignment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13bTSglyaDaWSoZkn0eO90w2CTuYDjUzrTS615vP_a_c/edit?usp=sharing).</u>

**Technology** **Suggestions:**

> ● **Backend:** You may use any technology of your choice. Common
> options include MERN stack (Node.js/Express) or Python frameworks such
> as Flask or FastAPI.
>
> ● **Voice** **AI** **API:** We recommend using free trial credits for
> audio-to-audio API from services like Gemini, OpenAI, Sarvam or
> ElevenLabs. You are free to use any other service. You should activate
> a free trial to get the necessary API keys.

**Assignment** **Details:**

This assignment consists of three parts. The final product should be a
simple web page with a microphone button to initiate a voice
conversation with the "Loop AI agent".

**UI** **Example:**

> A minimal web page that includes:
>
> ● A title such as “Loop AI Hospital Network Assistant” ● A large,
> centered microphone icon button
>
> ● A label under the button that says “Start Conversation”

**Part** **1:** **API** **Integration** **and** **Data** **Loading**

> ● Create a simple interface with a single button to start and stop the
> voice conversation.
>
> ● Integrate your chosen voice-to-voice API to handle user speech input
> and generate a spoken response.
>
> ● Load the provided hospital data file (CSV). Since it is assumed to
> be very large files, you must devise a strategy to access and search
> this data efficiently without sending the entire file to the AI model.
>
> ● Implement the core logic to answer user queries. Your solution will
> be tested specifically on its ability to answer:
>
> 1\. "Tell me 3 hospitals around Bangalore."
>
> 2\. "Can you confirm if Manipal Sarjapur in Bangalore is in my
> network?."
>
> ● **Hint:** To handle the large dataset, we strongly encourage
> exploring modern techniques like creating an Retrieval-Augmented
> Generation (RAG) vector database of the hospitals list or extract
> search keywords from user query
>
> ● using function calling/structured outputs for doing an ‘exact match’
> search on the hospital database.

**Part** **2:** **Introduction** **and** **followups**

> ● The voice agent must introduce itself as a “Loop AI" at the
> beginning of the conversation. ● The agent should be able to handle
> simple follow-up questions after providing an initial
>
> answer.
>
> ● If the user query is insufficient, it should ask clarifying
> questions like “I have found several hospitals with this name, In
> which city are you looking for Apollo hospital?”

**Part** **3:** **Error** **Handling** **and** **connecting** **with**
**Twilio** **phone** **number** **(optional** **for** **Brownie**
**points)**

> ● Implement a mechanism to detect when a user's question is out of
> scope (i.e., not related to finding hospitals in the provided list).
>
> ● When an out-of-scope question is detected, the agent must politely
> respond with, "I'm sorry, I can't help with that. I am forwarding this
> to a human agent," and then end the interaction.
>
> ● Connect this API with an actual phone number on a Twilio trial
> account.

Part 1 of this assignment is compulsory.

**Submission** **Requirements:**

> ● **Loom** **Video** **Demo:** Submit a link to a short (approx. 1-2
> minute) Loom video demonstrating a live conversation with your voice
> agent. The video must show you asking the two test questions
> mentioned.
>
> ● **Public** **GitHub** **Link:** Provide a link to a public GitHub
> repository containing your source code.

**Evaluation:**

> ● **Functionality** **First**: Your assignment will be primarily
> evaluated on functionality. The agent must successfully answer the
> test queries in a voice conversation with minimum latency.
>
> ● **Use** **of** **AI** **Tools**: The use of AI tools (e.g., Cursor,
> ChatGPT, Claude Code ) to assist in writing code is encouraged.
> However, an understanding of your code and workflow APIs you are using
> is required, as this will be evaluated in the technical interview.
>
> ● **No** **ML** **Expertise** **Needed**: You do not need to build or
> understand the internal workings of AI models. You only need to know
> how to effectively call and utilize the provided APIs.
>
> ● **Code** **Quality**: Our evaluation focuses on functionality and
> correct API integration. Clean code is appreciated but not required.

**Deadline:**

> ● You are expected to spend **24** **hours** to complete this
> assignment.
